# Smart Assistant Project (Python Project Tutorial)

This is a **step-by-step tutorial project** in Python.  
Each step introduces **one Python concept** and builds on the previous step, so by the end youâ€™ll have a **Smart Personal Assistant** with features like AI, Data Analysis, BI, and Excel automation.

### âœ… [Step 3: Operators](Step03_Operators/operators.py)
**Concepts Covered:**
- Arithmetic Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`
- Comparison Operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- Logical Operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- Assignment Operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`

**How to Run:**
```bash```
python Step03_Operators/operators.py

**Expected Output:**

Enter first number: 3
Enter second number: 2

--- Arithemetic Operators ---
Addition: 3.0 + 2.0 = 5.0
Subtraction: 3.0 - 2.0 = 1.0
Multiplication: 3.0 * 2.0 = 6.0
Division: 3.0 / 2.0 = 1.5
Floor Division: 3.0 // 2.0 = 1.0
Modulus: 3.0 % 2.0 = 1.0
Exponent: 3.0 ** 2.0 = 9.0

--- Comparision Operator ---
Equal To: 3.0 == 2.0 : False 
Not Equal To: 3.0 != 2.0 : True
Greater Than: 3.0 > 2.0 : True
Less Than: 3.0 < 2.0 : False
Greater Than Equal To: 3.0 >= 2.0 : True
Less Than Equal To: 3.0 <= 2.0 : False

--- Logical Operators ---
AND Operator: True and False : False
OR Operator: True or False : True
NOT Operator: not True : not False

NOT Operator: not True : not False

--- Assignment Operator ---
Equals: x = 3.0
Plus Equals: x += 2.0 -> x = 5.0
Plus Equals: x += 2.0 -> x = 5.0
Multiply Equals: x *= 2 -> x = 10.0
Divide Equals: x /= 3 -> x = 3.3333333333333335
